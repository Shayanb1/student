    "## How has collaboration helped me in CSP?\n",
    "\n",
    "I get stuck many times when teachers give instructions, which is why I feel like it is good for me to be around people that I feel comfortable reaching out to for help. One difficult task for me to learn was how to open a github repo in VS code through my terminal, at first, even after the lecture, I had no idea what to do, but my peers around me help me learn things easily which is why I feel like collaboration is so important to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now collaboration isn't just asking people to help you out when you're stuck, I have learned throughout this course that collaboration can also be to work together on a project, assigning tasks in a project, making a plan, etc. Collaboration has helped me work with my peers to complete separate/similar tasks at very efficient rates which helps me have good work.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "# Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I learned:**\n",
    "Verify and update my tools, clone and fork repositories, open GitHub repos in VS Code, activate a virtual environment, and change sprites/backgrounds in a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges I faced:**\n",
    "Opening a github repo in VS code, reaching out to others for help, planning accordingly for projects, debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Growth:**\n",
    "I became more confident in using GitHub and the terminal, and I also learned how to explain steps clearly when teaching my teammates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaboration impact:**\n",
    "Collaboration helped me learn faster, solve problems I was stuck on, and also gave me the chance to teach my teammates skills like cloning and forking repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future impact:**\n",
    "These skills will help me work better on group projects in CSP and in future coding classes, since I now understand how to use GitHub, VS Code, and teamwork more effectively. I know that collaboration and communication will continue to be important in computer science, because coding is rarely done alone. By practicing these skills now, I will be more prepared for future classes, internships, or even real world programming jobs where teamwork and problem solving are essential."

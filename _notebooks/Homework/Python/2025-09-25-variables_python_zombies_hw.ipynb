    "1. **Create at least 8 variables** to describe a character or yourself.  \n",

    "   `name`, `age`, `favorite_food`, `hobby`, `number_of_pets`, `mood`, `favorite_color`, `dream_job`\n",

    "2. **Assign initial values** to all variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reassign at least 4 of the variables** to new values to simulate changes over time or ‚Äúevents‚Äù in the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use **print statements** to write a story or profile that is **at least 5 sentences long**.  \n",
    "   Each sentence should include at least one variable.  \n",
    "   Example:  \n",
    "   > \"Tanay ('age' 17) loves pizza and plays tennis ('hobby') every weekend. Today, Tanay is happy because he ate his ('favoirite_food').\"\n",

    "5. Optional: Add **extra variables** to make your story longer and more creative.  \n",

   "source": "## Homework Summary: Variables & Assignments\n\nThis homework assignment focused on understanding **variables and assignments** in programming, covering fundamental concepts through hands-on coding exercises and conceptual questions.\n\n### Popcorn Hack 1: Variable Declaration and String Concatenation\nIn this exercise, I completed code that demonstrated:\n- **Variable declaration**: Created two variables - `snakeSize` (assigned value 8) and `snakeColor` (assigned value \"yellow\")\n- **Data types**: Worked with both integer and string data types\n- **Type conversion**: Used `str()` function to convert the integer `snakeSize` to a string for concatenation\n- **String concatenation**: Combined multiple strings and variables using the `+` operator to create a descriptive output\n- **Output**: \"The snake is 8 inches long and it's yellow.\"\n\nThis demonstrated how variables store different types of data and how they can be combined in output statements.\n\n### Popcorn Hack 2: Conditional Logic with Variables\nThis exercise explored:\n- **Message variables**: Defined `messageWin` (\"You Win\") and `messageLose` (\"You Lose\") to store outcome messages\n- **Control flow variable**: Created `winOrLose` variable set to \"Win\" to determine program flow\n- **Conditional statements**: Used an `if-else` structure to check the value of `winOrLose`\n- **Program logic**: The code checks if `winOrLose == \"win\"` (case-sensitive), and since it was set to \"Win\" (capital W), the condition was false, resulting in \"You Lose\" being printed\n- **Key learning**: This highlighted the importance of case sensitivity in string comparisons and how variables control program execution paths\n\n### Variable Naming Best Practices\nEvaluated three pairs of variable names to understand naming conventions:\n1. **highScore vs highestScoreInTheGame**: Chose `highScore` - demonstrates that variable names should be concise yet descriptive, avoiding unnecessary verbosity\n2. **firstName vs 1stName**: Chose `firstName` - variable names cannot start with numbers in most programming languages; use camelCase for readability\n3. **ID vs studentID**: Chose `studentID` - more specific names provide better context and make code self-documenting, improving code readability and maintenance\n\nThese choices reflect best practices in variable naming: use camelCase, avoid starting with numbers, balance brevity with clarity, and provide sufficient context.\n\n### Multiple Choice Quiz\nCompleted a team-based multiple choice quiz to reinforce understanding of variables, assignments, data types, and programming conventions covered in the lesson.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n- Variables are containers that store data values\n- Proper variable naming improves code readability and maintainability\n- Understanding data types and type conversion is essential for operations like string concatenation\n- Variables control program flow through conditional logic\n- Case sensitivity matters in programming"

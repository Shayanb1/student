    "## 1) Myself now compared to me at the start of the year \n",
    "\n",
    "- I learned how to actually set up my tools rather than making someone else do it for me\n",
    "- I gained more experince helping others rather than forcing other people to do my work (like last year)\n",
    "- I learned how to update my tools\n",
    "- I learned how to use new features to make my websites function more efficiently and look better (ex: CSS & Footers)\n",
    "\n",
    "My biggest improvement of myself now compared to the beginning of the year is definetly how I gained experience with helping out people who were confused and learned how I can help others learn from me\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1 - (West Coast) Lots of planning is needed in order to be on the same page as other groups, for example, each group in our West Coast project had to think of a theme that relates to a travel plan in the west coast.\n",
    "### 2 - We gathered feedback to make our project simpler so its easy for people to understand and learn from. So the take away is to seek feedback thoughout the project\n",
    "### 3 - In the west coast travel project, I learned that shorter, and more interactive lessons work more effieciently than just a giant page of words\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3)  How N@tM went?  Did you get a comment or two you liked?\n",
    "\n",
    "- N@TM was really fun for me, I got to look at CSSE projects and think of how they differed from mine last year\n",
    "- I presented to many parents which helped me improve my speaking & presenting skills\n",
    "\n",
    "### I had some helpful feedback comments that let me know what was good about our project, but I wanted some more comments about how my group can improve\n",

    "## 4) What do you want to do next on project, given time?\n",
    "On the West Coast project I would like to make my groups's sub modules shorter and more interactive for listeners to feel more connected to our topic and interested in learning more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5) What do you want to learn next in CompSci?\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to learn how to write unit tests and do test driven development because I know that is a popular way of software development in computer science.\n",
